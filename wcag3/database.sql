Therefore technologies should allow authors to provide pronunciation and meaning guidance for these language features.'),(53,NULL,NULL,'uthors can support correct machine pronunciation of ambiguously spelled terms (e.g., in the phrase \"I am content with this content\" there are different correct pronunciations of the lexeme \"content\").','Many languages have lexical features that can be pronounced different ways and that carry different meanings. Context generally clarifies intent, but this can be less effective when assistive technologies use default pronunciations. Therefore technologies should provide features to allow authors to clarify pronunciation intent when needed.'),(54,NULL,NULL,'Authors can identify regions of content, particularly the \"main\" region.','Users of some assistive technologies experience content in a linear fashion, which can make it hard to find intended content that is located after several blocks of less relevant content such as navigation and sidebars. Other users have difficulty making sense of the page design due to complexity or the effects of magnification. Supporting users to find relevant content quickly is important to effective use, and the best way to do this is to provide ways to identify regions of content easily. This can be done via headings but region type semantics is also particularly helpful. The main content region is the most important for users to find quickly, but other regions such as navigation, headers, footers, sidebars, and subsections are also important. Technologies should provide features to allow authors to identify content regions.'),(55,NULL,NULL,'Declarative mechanisms (that have accessibility semantics pre-defined in the spec) are used to implement technology features whenever possible.','Declarative technologies create sets of pre-defined semantics that authors use to structure content. Because the semantics are well-defined, they can be broadly supported across the entire tool chain, including by assistive technologies. Imperative technologies, by contrast, don\'t define semantics in advance, which allows creation of new forms of content but requires authors to implement all aspects of the user experience, including accessibility aspects that are frequently overlooked. For this reason, technologies should provide declarative semantics for known feature types.'),(56,NULL,NULL,'There are unambiguous ways to express relationships between units of content, such as object nesting, ID referencing, etc.','Providing an accessible user experience sometimes requires tools to combine the features of or support rapid navigation between multiple related objects. Technologies should provide ways for authors to define these relationships clearly and unambiguously.'),(57,NULL,NULL,'Prefer structural semantics to presentational semantics.','Structural semantics provide information about the role of content within the whole, while presentational semantics define intended presentation.

Common time limits can be time for response before a login session expires, or time before content automatically refreshes or changes. When technologies allow authors to set time limits, they should provide ways for users to request extensions to the time limit - before the expiration of the limit causes a disastrous interruption to their use.
